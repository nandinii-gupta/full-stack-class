    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my little corner! 
      Here I share my daily experiences, hobbies, and thoughts.  
      Writing helps me reflect on life and connect with people who share similar journeys.
    </p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reading books & blogs</li>
      <li>Sketching and creative art</li>
      <li>Coding small fun projects</li>
      <li>Listening to music & podcasts</li>
      <li>Exploring new tech ideas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Daily Routine</h2>
    <p> 
      During the day, I balance my time between studying, coding, and personal growth.  
      In the evenings, I like to journal, reflect, and sometimes binge-watch a good series. 
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My current focus is on improving my development skills, working on small projects,  
      and building a portfolio that reflects my journey. Step by step, I want to grow  
      into a skilled full-stack developer.
